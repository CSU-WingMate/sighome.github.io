Welcome to the SIG Laboratory of the School of Electronic Information Engineering at Central South University！
SIG upholds a rigorous scientific research attitude and a noble humanistic spirit. 
Our labmates not only achieve abundant research outcomes and worry-free graduation, but also boast an extremely high rate of finding romantic partners, balancing academic pursuit and love life perfectly.
With one hand holding hands with Tsinghua University, SIG enjoys the opportunity to attend group meetings directly taught by professors from Tsinghua. With the other hand holding hands with Alibaba, we have access to multiple collaborative projects and rare opportunities for summer internships and full-time positions.
Below, we will provide a detailed introduction to the basic situation within the group, including **team members**, **research directions**, and **mentor  Handbook**.

research directions
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
